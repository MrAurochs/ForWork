	<h1> The Cottage Garden </h1>
	<p> The <i> cottage garden</i> is a distinct style of garden that uses an informal design, dense plantings and a mixture of edible and ornamental plants</p> 
	<p> The Cottage Garden originated in <a href = "http://www.google.com">England</a> and its history can be traced back for centuries, 
	although they were re-invented in 1870's England, when stylized versions were formed as a reaction to the more structured and rigorously 
	maintained <ins><a href = "http://www.google.com", target = "_blank"> English estate gardens </a></ins>
	</p>
	<p> The earliest cottage gardens were more practical than their modern descendants, with an emphasis on their vegetables and their herbs along with some fruit trees
