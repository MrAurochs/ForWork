	<div> If you noticed, reading the source, everything in html is placed between brackets with a few symbols in them, these are called "tags" and everything in html is done with tags. 
	<br/> for instance, the line break I just made was done with the break tab and all the text you are reading here is made with a div or division tag. </div>

	<ol>  
		<li> web development is fun</li>
		<li> web development is relatively easy to learn and do</li> 
		<li> junior (starting) front end web developers can earn around 20,000$ a year in America, $2,000/year probably here in Uganda 
		or 6.8 million shillings a year</li> 
		<li> Impress your friends </li>
		<li> Pay is not dependent upon the presene or absence of drought </li> 
		<li> Exploding cat memes aside, not hazardous to your health</li> 
	</ol>
	
	
	<h2> maybe you want to want to make an unordered list though, say about your favorite foods </h2> 
	<ul>
		<li>Mango </li> 
		<li> Bundu </li>
		<li> Goatmeat </li> 
		<li> Rolex </li>

	<h2> there's also definition lists <h2> 
	<dl> 
		<dt>Bundu </dt> 
		
		<dd> Cassava flour mixed with water, often eaten with the hands. Popular in Central and East Africa </dd>
		<br/> 
		<dt> Deoxyribonucleic acid</dt> 
		<dd> a long double stranded molecule made up of repeating units of a phosphate group, a varying nucleic acid, and a sugar unit. The pattern of the nucleic acids codes for proteins and is used in all animal cells </dd>

	<h2> Sometimes you need to make text appear differently, for example: <h2>
	<p> I arrived to Uganda on the 15 <sup>th </sup> of May, since I've been here I've drank a lot of H<sub>2</sub>O or water. </p>
	<p> my favorite thing to buy in Uganda is <del> watermelon</del> honey </p>

	<p> the above was a break, here's another </p> 
	
	<hr>
	<p> <ins> here's some underlined, er, "inserted" text here </ins> </p> 
	
	<p> you can create links to other webpages as well <a href = "HelloWorld.html">like this one </a></p>

	<p>As professor Silver-Pell would say <q> you can also use a special command to quote people, pretty neat, huh? </q>  </p>
	
	<p> sometimes you want people to hover their mouse over an acronym or abbreviation and display what it means in full, for example, if you hover over <acronym title = "National Aviation and Space Administration">  NASA  </acronym>  you will find out what it means </p>
	<p> let's say you want to cite someone elses work, html has a special tag for that too: </p>
	<p> <cite> A Brief History of Time</cite> by stephen hawking is considered a good introductory text to quantum physics</p>
	
	<p>  there's also special tags for addresses: </br> <address>74 kilembe road</address> </br> 
	and you can link to internet addresses as well <a href= "mailto:aaron.silverpell@gmail.com"> aaron.silverpell@gmail</a>

	<p> this is a picture of a table selling bananas and tomatoes as is typical in the market.  Quite extraordinary really. 
	I counted and there were around 1,000 vendors in the market in kasese. They sold bananas, mangoes, passionfruit, wood, belts, cookware
	beans, Irish potatoes, bundu, pineapples and watermelon amongst many other things.  I bought some garlic as well. In America, we have supermarkets which
    sell tens of thousands of different kinds of items though. One store can make the entire market look small. 	</p>
